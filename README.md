This logistic regression model predicts whether a video game should be classified as a “Must Play” game (METASCORE ≥ 90) based on its user reviews, utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP). 
Utilizes text preprocessing, wordcloud, and logistic regression against a Kaggle dataset with 5K video games and 284K user reviews.
